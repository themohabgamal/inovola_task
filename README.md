This repository contains a comprehensive expense tracking application built with Flutter. The app features a clean, modern interface for users to monitor their finances, add new expenses with multi-currency support, and view an interactive dashboard. It is architected following Clean Architecture principles for robustness and scalability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Expense Management**: Seamlessly add new expenses with a title, amount, category, date, and an optional receipt image.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Log expenses in various international currencies. The app fetches real-time exchange rates from `exchangerate-api.com` and displays the converted value in USD for clarity.
